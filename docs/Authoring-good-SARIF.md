# Appendix A: Authoring "good" SARIF

This Appendix describes those features of SARIF which,
although not strictly required by the specification,
are in the opinion of the editors

The specification isn't as helpful as it might be because it's restricted to describing features as
**MAY** (truly optional), **SHOULD** (do it unless you have a good reason not to) or **SHALL** (mandatory).
There are no shades of gray, and no editorializing,
as in "we really wanted to make this mandatory but there's this one prominent tool that doesn't do it, so we had to make it optional."

So in this app
