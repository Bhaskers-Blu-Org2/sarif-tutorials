# Glossary

<a id="analysis-tool"></a>**analysis tool**: A tool that produces observations about a set of programming
<a href="#artifact">_artifacts_</a>, for example by detecting <a href="#issue">_issues_</a>
or calculating metrics.

<a id="artifact"></a>**artifact**: Anything produced by the act of programming, such as a source file, an object file,
or a web page.

<a id="binding"></a>**binding**: An association between two sets of entities.
In this context, the association between the entities defined by the SARIF <a href="#object-model">_object model_</a>
and their representation in a programming language.

<a id="dynamic-analysis-tool"></a>**dynamic analysis tool**: An <a href="#analysis-tool">_analysis tool_</a> that
observes the execution of a program.

<a id="first-class-property"></a>**first-class property**: A property defined by the SARIF specification, as opposed to
one that occurs in a <a href="#property-bag">_property bag_</a>.

<a id="issue"></a>**issue**: A condition in a program that might detract from its quality.

<a id="logical-location"></a>**logical location**: A location specified by name, without reference to a particular
<a href="artifact">_artifact_</a>, for example, by means of a class name and a method name.

<a id="object-model"></a>**object model**: A set of classes and associations among them that describes a problem domain.
In this context, the set of classes that describe the contents of a SARIF log file.

<a id="physical-location"></a>**physical location**: A location specified by reference to a particular
<a href="#artifact">_artifact_</a>, for example, by means of a file name and a line number.

<a id="post-processor"></a>**post-processor**: A program that takes a SARIF file, modifies it,
and produces a new SARIF file with the modifications.

<a id="primary-executable"></a>**primary executable**: The component of an <a href="#analysis-tool">analysis tool</a>
in which execution begins, for example, a binary file containing the program entry point.

**NOTE**: The spec isn't clear on this point, but I consider the "primary executable" to include the libraries
with which the entry point binary is linked. The reason is that the spec contrasts the primary executable
with "extensions", which are typically authored separately from the tool, and discovered dynamically by the tool.

<a id="result"></a>**result**: An observation about an artifact, often but not always an <a href="#issue">_issue_</a>.

<a id="property-bag"></a>**property bag**: A SARIF property named `properties` that can contain any property
with any value.

<a id="rule-metadata"></a>**rule metadata**: Information that describes a rule supported by
an <a href="#analysis-tool">_analysis tool_</a>.

<a id="static-analysis-tool"></a>**static analysis tool**: An <a href="#analysis-tool">_analysis tool_</a>
that examines programming <a href="#artifact">_artifacts_</a> without executing the program.
